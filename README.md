# Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest
A personal side project for self-coding decision tree and random forest algorithm using Python.  

## **Python Files:**  
**Nodes.py:** Class file for 'Node' and 'Leaf' object.  
**Question.py** Class file for 'Question' object.  
**UtilityFunctions.py:** Contains various utility functions for decision tree and random forest.  
**DecisionTree.py:** Python file to build and use a Decision Tree model.  
**RandomForest.py:** Python file to build and use a Random Forest model.  
  
  
## **Others:**
**Toy_Dataset.xlsx:** An example Excel toy dataset to run the program. Can be swapped with other Excel datasets.
**mytree.txt:** An example decision tree model file generated by using the saveModel() function.
**myforest.txt:** An example random forest model file generated using the saveModel() function.
